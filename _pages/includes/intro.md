# About Me

Hi~ :ghost: I am Yu Xia (夏羽), a 2nd-year master student at University of Michigan. Prior to this, I earned my bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I have been working closely with Prof. [Shuai Li](https://shuaili8.github.io/) and Dr. [Tong Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6-ARmXsAAAAJ) on **Large Language Models** and **Conversational Recommender Systems**. 

I am broadly interested in research topics in Data Mining and Natural Language Processing.
