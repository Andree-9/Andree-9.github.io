# About Me

Hi~ üèñÔ∏è: I am Yu Xia (Â§èÁæΩ), a 1st-year CSE PhD student at University of California San Diego, where I am working with Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) on **Large Language Models** and **Conversational Recommendation**. I earned my bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and master's degree from University of Michigan. 

Currently I am interested in **RL / Finetuning** of LLMs / LLM Agents for applications under various scenarios. Feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:yux078@ucsd.edu) if you would like to discuss anything or explore potential collaborations!
