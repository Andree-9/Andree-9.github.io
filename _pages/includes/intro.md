# About Me

Hi~ :ghost: I am Yu Xia (夏羽), a 1st-year CSE PhD student at University of California San Diego, where I am working with Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) on **Large Language Models** and **Conversational Recommendation**. I earned my bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and master's degree from University of Michigan. 

Currently I am interested in **RL Finetuning** of LLMs and **Hallucination** Mitigation. Feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:yux078@ucsd.edu) if you would like to discuss anything or explore potential collaborations!
