Hi! :wave: I am Yu Xia (夏羽), a 2nd-year master student at University of Michigan. Prior to this, I earned my bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2023. 

I have been collaborating closely with Prof. [Shuai Li](https://shuaili8.github.io/) and Dr. [Tong Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6-ARmXsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) on **Conversational Recommender Systems** and **Large Language Models**. 

I am broadly interested in research topics in Data Mining and Natural Language Processing.
