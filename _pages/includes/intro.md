# About Me

Hi~ :ghost: I am Yu Xia (夏羽), a 1st-year CSE PhD student at University of California San Diego, where I will be working with Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/). I earned my bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and master's degree from University of Michigan, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Shuai Li](https://shuaili8.github.io/) and Dr. [Tong Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6-ARmXsAAAAJ) on **Large Language Models** and **Conversational Recommender Systems**. 

I am broadly interested in research topics in Data Mining and Natural Language Processing.
